# React + TypeScript + Vite + React Server

This is a [React Server](https://reactserver.dev) template for Vite. Read the docs for more info.

## Quickstart

You can use this template to quickly setup a new Frontend:

```bash
npx degit state-less/template-vite-react-server my-frontend
cd my-frontend
yarn
yarn dev --mode=production
```

This will clone our template with all the neccessary setup to connect to a React Server instance.

_Note:_ Starting the server in production mode connects to our live server, so you can take a look at the frontend without starting a server yourself.
